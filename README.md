[DEPLOYED ON HEROKU](https://git.heroku.com/shielded-ocean-87626.git)


## DEVELOPMENT

The Note Taker allows the user to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend and saves/retrieves note data from a JSON file.


## USER STORY

As a user, I want to organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete. I need to be able to write and save notes. I also want the ability to delete the notes.

## BUSINESS CONTEXT

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

*Add a category to their notes
*Organize their notes via selectors (date created, title, category, etc)
*Create multiple notepads to separate note types
